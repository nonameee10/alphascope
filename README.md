# AlphaScope

AlphaScope is a Python program designed to scan and identify potential privacy leaks in Windows settings and applications. It focuses on analyzing registry entries, file system paths, and privacy settings that could compromise user privacy.

## Features

- Scans specified Windows registry paths for potential privacy leaks.
- Analyzes specified file system paths for log and temporary files that might contain sensitive information.
- Checks Windows privacy settings to identify potentially unsafe configurations.
- Generates a JSON report summarizing the findings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows operating system (as it uses Windows-specific libraries)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alphascope.git

   ```

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python alphascope.py
   ```

2. The program will generate a report named `alphascope_report.json` in the current directory.

## Configuration
